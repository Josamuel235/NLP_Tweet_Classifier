# NLP_Tweet_Classifier
 
This project creates a bi-directional LSTM model that is trained on tweets from the Kaggle Tweet Sentiment dataset. The data set has over 50000 tweets that are categorized as toxic and not toxic. The trained model reaches a test accuracy of 94%.

If you would like to downlaod the model click this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ro7oNQHjaRbSrHIvDYKNRaFPni5dH_7A?usp=sharing

Instructions to run GUI:
First download the LSTM_Architecture.py, tok_to_work, tok_track, and UI.py. Then download the model from the google drive link. Make sure all downlaoded files are in same directory. After that run the UI.py file, 2 links will pop up after 10 or so seconds click the second link first (the link that ends with .live) if that doesnt work click the frist link. If the first link doesnt work then download the GUI_test.ipynb and put it in the same directory as the other downlaoded files. Open the GUI_test.ipynb and run the entire notebook see if the GUI opens after the last cell. If this doesnt work either the servers are down
